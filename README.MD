# Python FX

This project uses Oanda's V20 API and the OandaPyV20 Wrapper to communicate with Oanda's servers and try to make sense of the candles and use them to make some money, hopefully!

# Usage

To use this project add your Oanda Token to src/api/env/api-details.py

You will need to refer to Oanda's instructions on how to obtain this.
